#procs

#Remember when we told you that everything is an object in Ruby? Well, we sort of fibbed. Blocks are not objects, and this is one of the very few exceptions to the "everything is an object" rule in Ruby.

#Because of this, blocks can't be saved to variables and don't have all the powers and abilities of a real object. For that, we'll need... procs!

#You can think of a proc as a "saved" block: just like you can give a bit of code a name and turn it into a method, you can name a block and turn it into a proc. Procs are great for keeping your code DRY, which stands for Don't Repeat Yourself. With blocks, you have to write your code out each time you need it; with a proc, you write your code once and can use it many times!

multiples_of_3 = Proc.new do |n|
  n % 3 == 0
end

(1..100).to_a.select(&multiples_of_3)

# ==> [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96, 99]


# proc syntax
# Procs are easy to define! You just call Proc.new and pass in the block you want to save. Here's how we'd create a proc called cube that cubes a number (raises it to the third power):

cube = Proc.new { |x| x ** 3 }

#We can then pass the proc to a method that would otherwise take a block, and we don't have to rewrite the block over and over!

[1, 2, 3].collect!(&cube)
# ==> [1, 8, 27]
[4, 5, 6].map!(&cube)
# ==> [64, 125, 216]

#(The .collect! and .map! methods do the exact same thing.)

#The & is used to convert the cube proc into a block (since .collect! and .map! normally take a block). We'll do this any time we pass a proc to a method that expects a block.

#The .floor method rounds a float (a number with a decimal) down to the nearest integer. Write a proc called round_down that will do this rounding (we've added the code to pass it to floats.collect).

floats = [1.2, 3.45, 0.91, 7.727, 11.42, 482.911]
# Write your code below this line!

round_down = Proc.new { |n| n.floor }


# Write your code above this line!
ints = floats.collect(&round_down)

# ==> [1, 3, 0, 7, 11, 482]

# WHY PROCS?
#  1. Procs are full-fledged objects, so they have all the powers and abilities of objects. (Blocks do not.)
#  2. Unlike blocks, procs can be called over and over without rewriting them. This prevents you from having to retype the contents of your block every time you need to execute a particular bit of code.

# Here at the amusement park, you have to be four feet tall
# or taller to ride the roller coaster. Let's use .select on
# each group to get only the ones four feet tall or taller.

group_1 = [4.1, 5.5, 3.2, 3.3, 6.1, 3.9, 4.7]
group_2 = [7.0, 3.8, 6.2, 6.1, 4.4, 4.9, 3.0]
group_3 = [5.5, 5.1, 3.9, 4.3, 4.9, 3.2, 3.2]

can_ride_1 = group_1.select { |height| height >= 4 }
can_ride_2 = group_2.select { |height| height >= 4 }
can_ride_3 = group_3.select { |height| height >= 4 }

#Man, we had to rewrite that block a bunch of times! Remove the blocks and replace them with a proc called over_4_feet so that the code in the block only needs to be written once.

over_4_feet = Proc.new { |height| height >= 4 } # ---> produces error. Correction on lines 67-68

over_4_feet = Proc.new do |height| height >= 4 
end


can_ride_1 = group_1.select(&over_4_feet)
can_ride_2 = group_2.select(&over_4_feet)
can_ride_3 = group_3.select(&over_4_feet)

#create your own
#1.  Create a method, greeter, that takes no arguments and yields to a block.
#2.  Create a proc, phrase, that puts "Hello there!". Pass this to greeter instead of a block. (Don't forget to pass &phrase instead of just phrase!)

#Your method should look something like this:
#def method_name
#  yield
#end

#And your proc should look something like this:
#proc_name = Proc.new do
#  puts "Text"
#end

def greeter
  yield
end

phrase = Proc.new { puts "Hello there!" }

greeter(&phrase)

# Unlike blocks, we can call procs directly by using Ruby's .call method. Check it out!

# test = Proc.new { # does something }
# test.call
# # does that something!

hi = Proc.new { puts "Hello!" }
hi.call

# symbols meet procs

# Now that you're learning some of the more complex parts of the Ruby language, you can combine them to work some truly arcane magicks. For instance, remember when we told you that you could pass a Ruby method name around with a symbol? Well, you can also convert symbols to procs using that handy little &.

# Check it out:

# strings = ["1", "2", "3"]
# nums = strings.map(&:to_i)
# # ==> [1, 2, 3]

# By mapping &:to_i over every element of strings, we turned each string into an integer!

# Using the example in the instructions as a guide, use collect or map to create the strings_array from the numbers_array. Each element of strings_array should be the string version of the corresponding element from the numbers_array (that is, it should go ["1", "2", "3"... "10"]).

numbers_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

strings_array = numbers_array.map(&:to_s)
